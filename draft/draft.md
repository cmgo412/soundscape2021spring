# Soundscape Draft Log

I attempted to complete the bulk of my soundscape project with this draft. For a quick summary, here are a couple quick notes of changes I made while working:
- Added right/left and left/right pan with mosquito sound effect
- Added clap sound after mosquito effect
- Added sound clip of sleeping bag and removed background noise
  - first selected beginning of clip with silence (to record background noise)
  - effects > noise reduction > get sound profile
  - selected entire audio clip/tracks
  - effects > noise reduction > OK
- Added sound clip of tent (coat) zipper and removed background noise
- Duplicated sound clip of footsteps when narrator goes back to tent
- Added static, weather report audio, and button clicks to imitate turning the radio on/off
- Added crickets
- Reordered sounds
- Added guitar melody
- Added yawn before footsteps
- Faded out the sounds of the stream, campfire, music, and crickets when narrator steps away from campsite
- Updated README.md
- Updated ASSETS.md
