# <b>A Night in the Pocono Mountains</b>

This is the repository for my narrative soundscape assignment in Composing Digital Media (Spring 2021). Because the rationale behind the project is to explore the affordances of sound as a medium and how arranging layers of audio can immerse the listener in a particular environment and story space, I have decided to compose a soundscape that will attempt to recreate the experience of camping overnight in the woods with friends. All components for the project are explained below. *For more information regarding the assignment, please refer to [assignment.md](https://github.com/cmgo412/soundscape2021spring/blob/master/assignment.md).*


### Project Proposal

The idea for my soundscape is to try to emulate the feeling of camping in the woods near a river. Not only does it represent my fondness of hiking and adventuring outdoors, but it holds particular significance to me especially because it's one of my last memories of pre-pandemic social life. In fact, I found out the news of Pitt's COVID-19 evacuation plans during spring break last year in the Pocono Mountains. I'm not necessarily sure of the entire narrative of my soundscape yet, but I plan to try to recreate one of the moments from that trip: hanging out with a couple of my friends around a campfire while we play music and enjoy each other's company. To conclude the project, I'm considering having the listener retire to bed in their tent and sleeping bag, which would be symbolized sonically by fading the audio track. I'm especially excited to experiment with the different sound effects by adding reverb and adjusting the volume of the animal/insect sounds and playing around with the high pass filter for the radio.
